## Latest Updates

As of the most recent changes, we have successfully implemented a basic, functional Bitcoin-like blockchain with the following features and improvements:

1. **Functional Blockchain Core:** âœ…
   - Implemented a working blockchain structure that can add blocks, process transactions, and maintain chain integrity.
   - Successfully demonstrated the creation of multiple blocks, including a genesis block and subsequent transaction blocks.

2. **Transaction Processing:** âœ…
   - Implemented a system for creating, signing, and validating transactions.
   - Demonstrated successful transfer of funds between wallets.

3. **UTXO Model:** âœ…
   - Implemented a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model for tracking balances and validating transactions.
   - UTXO set is correctly updated with each new block and transaction.

4. **Wallet Functionality:** âœ…
   - Created a `Wallet` struct that generates private/public key pairs and Bitcoin-like addresses.
   - Implemented transaction signing using the wallet's private key.

5. **Mining Simulation:** âœ…
   - Implemented a basic Proof of Work (PoW) mining algorithm.
   - Added difficulty adjustment to maintain consistent block generation times.
   - Successfully demonstrated mining of new blocks with transactions.

6. **Merkle Tree:** âœ…
   - Implemented a Merkle tree for efficient and secure verification of block transactions.

7. **Balance Calculation:** âœ…
   - Implemented accurate balance calculation based on the UTXO set.

8. **Blockchain Information:** âœ…
   - Added functionality to display detailed information about the blockchain, including block details and transaction counts.

9. **Performance Improvements:** âœ…
   - Adjusted block generation time to 5 seconds for faster testing and development.
   - Implemented mining performance metrics, including mining time and hash rate.

10. **Peer-to-Peer Networking:** ðŸš§
    - Basic networking structure implemented.
    - Full P2P functionality still in progress.

11. **Advanced Scripting:** ðŸš§
    - Basic transaction scripts implemented.
    - More complex scripting capabilities in development.

12. **User Interface:** ðŸš§
    - Command-line interface basics implemented.
    - More user-friendly interface in progress.

## Key Components

1. **Blockchain Structure:**
   - `Blockchain` struct managing the chain of blocks and UTXO set.
   - Methods for adding blocks, processing transactions, and mining new blocks.

2. **Block and Transaction Structures:**
   - `Block` struct representing individual blocks in the chain, now including difficulty.
   - `Transaction` struct for representing transactions, including inputs and outputs.

3. **Wallet:**
   - `Wallet` struct for key management and address generation.
   - Methods for signing transactions.

4. **UTXO Set:**
   - `UTXOSet` struct for managing unspent transaction outputs.
   - Methods for adding, removing, and querying UTXOs.

5. **Merkle Tree:**
   - `MerkleTree` struct for creating and managing Merkle trees of transactions.

## Recent Improvements

1. Implemented dynamic difficulty adjustment to target 5-second block times.
2. Added mining performance metrics to measure mining time and hash rate.
3. Integrated Merkle tree for improved transaction verification.
4. Enhanced the main demonstration script to show a complete workflow of the blockchain, including multiple transactions and balance updates.
5. Improved logging and information display for debugging and verification.

## Next Steps

Potential areas for further development include:

1. Completing the peer-to-peer networking layer implementation.
2. Enhancing the scripting system for more complex transaction types.
3. Improving the command-line interface for better user interaction.
4. Implementing a simple block explorer functionality.
5. Adding more comprehensive test coverage.
6. Optimizing performance for handling larger transaction volumes.
