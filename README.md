Features

Functional Blockchain Core: âœ…

Implements a working blockchain structure that can add blocks, process transactions, and maintain chain integrity.
Successfully demonstrates the creation of multiple blocks, including a genesis block and subsequent transaction blocks.


Transaction Processing: âœ…

Supports creating, signing, and validating transactions.
Demonstrates successful transfer of funds between wallets.


UTXO Model: âœ…

Uses the Unspent Transaction Output model for tracking balances and validating transactions.
UTXO set is correctly updated with each new block and transaction.


Wallet Functionality: âœ…

Generates private/public key pairs and Bitcoin-like addresses.
Implements transaction signing using the wallet's private key.


Mining Simulation: âœ…

Implements a basic Proof of Work (PoW) mining algorithm.
Includes difficulty adjustment to maintain consistent block generation times.
Successfully demonstrates mining of new blocks with transactions.


Merkle Tree: âœ…

Implements Merkle trees for efficient and secure verification of block transactions.


Balance Calculation: âœ…

Accurately calculates balances based on the UTXO set.


Blockchain Information: âœ…

Displays detailed information about the blockchain, including block details and transaction counts.


Performance Improvements: âœ…

Adjusts block generation time to 5 seconds for faster testing and development.
Includes mining performance metrics, such as mining time and hash rate.


Mempool: âœ…

Implements a memory pool for managing unconfirmed transactions.
Transactions are held in the mempool before being included in a block.


Peer-to-Peer Networking: ðŸš§

Basic networking structure implemented.
Full P2P functionality still in progress.


Advanced Scripting: ðŸš§

Basic transaction scripts implemented.
More complex scripting capabilities in development.


User Interface: ðŸš§

Command-line interface basics implemented.
More user-friendly interface in progress.
